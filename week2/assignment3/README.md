Bootstrap, the grid is in some ways easier to use. The 12 part col system is pretty easy and intuitive in some ways but strange and difficult in others. The code used to implement things is somewhat obscure as opposed to doing itby hand where most things are named stuff that you know vaguely what it is just by the name. my- and py- and whatnot take come learning. Much more shorthand. It is nice to have a template that you can alter and tweak instead of creating all the css styling from scratch and taking care to make sure it all resizes appropriately at different screen sizes.
