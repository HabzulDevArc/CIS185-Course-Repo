# HTML Elements Assignment

**Student Name** William Allen
**Course** CIS 185
**Assignment 1:** HTML Elements Challenge
**Date:** 10/1/2025 (We might be a tad late on this assignment. I have a terrible habit of starting every quarter off on the back foot. Nothing more motivating than being behind though >.>;)

## Project Overview
I am learning to use various new HTML elements and CCS styling and using this project to demonstrate what I was able to decipher and perhaps what I was not. 

### 1. The viewport meta element:
This element is used to predifine some formatting depending on the size of the screen used to to view the page. I read that it was important for mobile devices and I wanted to see if I could understand this meta tag for mobile browsers and see if I could mess around with the paramaters and see the difference on my phone.

### 2. `<ruby>` annotation element:
While this element seems mostly used to annotate pronounciation of East Asian characters, my mind immediately went to using it for the purposes of strange page formatting to express small ideas or emphases in the middle of thoughts a la House of Leaves.

### 3. `<button>`
Buttons are used to allow users to interact or perform some sort of action on the page. I used 2 buttons to allow the user to select one option or the other. In doing so, the button when pressed would run a script that reveals an image with adjoined text depending on which button was pressed. 

### 4. `<pre>`
This element is used to display text exactly as it is formatted and I used it to ensure some ASCII art of a forest maintained it's structural integrity as it was loaded on the page.

### 5. `<script>`
The script element allows you to add code that can be executed within the page. In this assignment, I attached the script that displays an image and corresponding text to the buttons. When the user clicks one of the buttons, it runs the script which checks which button was pressed then displays the corresponding image and text on the screen.
